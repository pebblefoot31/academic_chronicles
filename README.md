This repo contains the work I did during my Dual Enrollment CS course with Pellissippi State Community College and Undergraduate CS courses at UTK thus far. A description of my work is as follows:

UTK/COSC_202 : Data Structures and Algorithms I

lab1 : This lab focuses on reading in weather data from a CSV file and implementing a 2D vector-array to output reformatted weather data summaries for several Tennessee cities. Full details of the assignment can be found in lab1.html.

lab2 : Similar to lab1, this lab also focused on dealing with weather data– but for several more cities across the US. In this lab, we still had to read in information from a CSV file; however, the  data management for each city was through a linked-list based implementation rather than a vector-array. Full details of the assignment can be found in lab2.html.

lab3 : In this lab, we developed a program that would determine whether or not a number was prime based on a maintained vector of already known prime numbers. The vector would be updated based on the condition that the number being processed is greater than the max known prime value. Full details of the assignment can be found in lab3.html.

lab4 : In this lab, I developed a program that used a hashtable to determine whether or not a user’s credentials were valid. The key would be the username and its corresponding value would be an encryption of the password. Full details of the assignment can be found in lab4.html. 

lab5 : In this lab, I developed a program that would read in binary I/O values of a ppm image and alter each pixel to apply any combination of a grayscale, lens, or flipped effect to the image. Full details of the assignment can be found in lab5.html

lab6 : In this lab, I developed a program that recursively calculated the correct combination of numbers and mathematical operations to reach a specified solution value. Full details of the assignment can be found in lab6.html

lab7 : In this lab, I developed code that would find a templated binary search tree’s upper and lower bounds, update pointers when a new value is inserted, and even output the details of the tree. Full details of the assignment can be found in lab7.html

lab8 : In this lab, I developed a program that recursively calculates the Goldbach partition of any  given number.  Full details of the assignment can be found in lab8.html
