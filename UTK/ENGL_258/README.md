**UTK/ENGL_258 : Honors Introduction to Fiction**
A course that taught me how to read between the lines of classic fiction. This repository contains a record of the writing work I have done in relation to the fiction we covered in class, including a few position papers and reading journals. In addition to notable short stories, listed below are the novels I read in this class and the type of analysis associated with each one: 

* _Hills Like White Elephants_ by Ernest Hemingway (position paper)
* _Frankenstein_ by Mary Shelley (position paper)
* _The Bluest Eye_ by Toni Morrison (position paper)
* _Metamorphosis_ by Franz Kafka (position paper)
* _The Remains of the Day_ by Kazuo Ishiguro (reading journal)
