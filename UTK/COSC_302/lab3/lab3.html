<h1> CS302 -- Lab Assignment 3 (80 pts: Spring 2024)</h1>

<hr>
<h3>Getting motivated</h3>
In this lab you will continue sorting the multi-column
data from Lab 2 which consisted of
a firstname, a lastname, and a phone number.
The main difference is that the data will
now be stored in double linked list. 
You will finish the implementation of mergesort from class
for explicitly sorting the nodes that hold the data.
You will also add a smart pointer based implementation 
that uses the std::sort() to get the job done.
<p>

CS307 students must also implement qsort_r3() 
which is a modified of the quicksort() algorithm 
from Lab 2 that does 3-way partitioning.
<p>

<hr>
<h3>Lab submission and due date</h3>
The due date for Prog3 is 11.59PM Thursday Feb 22, 2024. 
Submit a tar file that contains Prog3.cpp and Support.h.
The submitted code must compile and execute without
seg faulting to be graded.
<p>

<h3>Assignment details</h3>

Get a copy of lab3.tar from Canvas.  The file contains 
Prog3.cpp, which is a skeleton main program that will you expand on,
Support.h, which is a header file where most of the code goes,
a makefile for creating a Prog3 executable from these
two files, an sprog3 solution executable, and two files called 
repeat1.txt and repeat2.txt which contain test data. You can also
use the list[123].txt data files from Lab2.
<p>

NOTE: You will not be given incremental development guidelines.
Work relevant versions of the code out yourself. The goal should
be add enough new functionality to move your code forward but
not so much that you can't easily debug if/when things go wrong.
You only submit the final version.
<p>

<UL>

<LI>
<b>Prog3.cpp</b> Modify this file as follows. 
Add a private integer variable called ID to the data class.
Set this variable to the position of the data entry in
the input file. Do this by adding a static integer variable
with the same name to the overloaded input operator. Increment
this variable each time the operator is excuted and assign the
value to the data ID member. Update the output operator
to print the value of the data ID member 
(make the field 8 characters wide and right justified).
This simple addition will it possible to see whether
the data gets sorted in a stable manner or not.
See examples below.
<p>

Update the less-than data comparison operator to no longer
use the phone number as a tie-breaker. That is, 
data objects should be compared on a lastname, firstname
basis. This will create more cases where input data is
considered equal.
<p>

Update the main function to process command line
arguments, read input data into a linked list,
time and execute the specified sort algorithm,
and write the output to a named file.
When completed, any one of the following ways 
of executing Prog3 should be valid:
<p>

<pre>
unix> ./Prog3 -insertion list.txt
unix> ./Prog3 -mergesort list.txt
unix> ./Prog3 -stdsort list.txt

CS307 students must also support
unix> ./Prog3 -quicksort list.txt
</pre>

The insertion (sort) and mergesort options will apply
so named implements to directly reorder nodes of
the linked list. 
The stdsort and quicksort options will apply array-based
sorting to a vector that holds smart pointers.
This is all to a large extent based on code 
from the class06_sorting5_handout. Read this code
several times till you understand how all of it works.
<p>

<LI>
<b>Support.cpp</b> Modify this file as follows. 
Copy the sptr and dlist code from 
the class06_sorting5_handout verbatim.
Add an overloaded less-than operator
to the node class that compares key values.
Add a public quicksort(int mode) member function to
the dlist class. 
CS302 code always sets mode equal to 1.
CS307 code sets mode equal to 1 for stdsort
and 2 for quicksort.
<p>

Implement the dlist::merge() member function as
described in HW5.
<p>

Implement the dlist::quicksort() member 
function based on the <i>abstract ideas</i> behind the
data2ptr() and ptr2data() functions from
the class06_sorting5_handout. 
Determine the number of elements N stored in the sublist
considered.
Allocate a vector of smart pointers of that size
called Ap.
Initialize the individual smart pointers 
to point to the list nodes. 
Note that this is done differently from data2ptr().
Here, if p = head, then Ap[0] = p-&gt;next, and so forth.
Apply std::sort() and use the result to reorder the
dlist nodes.
This is also done differently from ptr2data().
Here, if p = head, then p-&gt;next = Ap[0], and so forth.
Simple as that (once you figure it out). You may
want to draw a picture of what's going on to
help visualize the process. Keep in mind that you
operate with pointers to dlist nodes, not pointers
to addresses of array elements. What you do here is
much easier.
<p>

<LI>
<b>Support.cpp</b> CS307 students are required to also 
add support for
commandline option quicksort which results in 
dlist::quicksort() applying an algorithm to be called
qsort_r3(). This is a modified version of the quicksort 
implementation from Lab 2. 
That algorithm used a randomly chosen pivot to partition 
data into three sublists, namely, {&le;}, pivot, {&ge;}.
The modified algorithm must create and maintain 
three sublists, namely, {&lt;}, {pivot=}, {&gt;}.
Another albeit minor difference is that the
recursion is initiated directly by dlist::quicksort().
The is possible since the bounding indices of interest
are known (namely, 0 and N-1).
See the notes from Class 5 for an abstract description
for how to do the 3-way partitioning. As a reminder,
pivot valued data are moved to the sublist ends during 
the partitioning and when done with that, 
a couple of for-loops move the pivot valued data 
next to the pivot after it has been placed at the
proper location.
You will likely struggle a bit until you wrap your 
head around the data movement, but rest asured that
the code changes are minimal.
Questions that pertain to the abstract nature of
the problem and its solution will be answered but
you must write the code on your own. That is, neither
the instructor nor the GTA will debug non-functioning
code.

The entries marked with an asterisk are equal entries for
which the input order is preserved. 
The entries marked with a plus sign are equal entries for
which the input order is not preverbed. 
Note that insertion sort and mergesort maintain the order 
while stdsort and quicksort sometimes do and sometimes don't. 
Also note that the latter two sometimes produce
a different sort order for equal data since they partition 
the data differently.
Finally, as always, compare your output against the solution
executable. Your computer may use a different random number
generator from the one used to produce the above.
