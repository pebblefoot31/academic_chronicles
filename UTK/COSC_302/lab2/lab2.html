<h1> CS302 -- Lab Assignment 2 (80 pts: Spring 2024)</h1>

<hr>
<h3>Getting motivated</h3>
Another week, another sorting assignment.
In this lab,
you will first define a class for storing multi-column data
consisting of a firstname, a lastname, and a phone number 
(all made up, but you knew that),
read an unspecified amounts of such data from a given file 
and apply
the std::sort algorithm before printing the result to stdout.
Then the real work begins by
you implementing a variant of the quicksort algorithm 
described in class that in its basic form replaces std::sort and
in a more advanced version uses the quickselect algorithm 
to first partition the data for a given range before sorting
it.
<p>

Read the assignment a couple of times. Look at the output 
examples. Run the solution code to become familiar 
with its behavior. Ask questions on Piazza so the whole
class can benefit if something is confusing. Chances are you 
are not alone. Do this for every lab assignment.
<p>

<h3>Lab submission and due date</h3>
The due date for Prog2 is 11.59PM Tuesday Feb 13, 2024. 
Submit a tar file that contains Prog2.cpp and Support.h.
The submitted code must compile and execute without
seg faulting to be graded.

<h3>Assignment details</h3>

Get a copy of lab2.tar from Canvas.  The file contains 
Prog2.cpp, which is a skeleton main program that will you expand on,
Support.h, which is a near-empty header file where the template
based sorting code goes, 
a makefile for creating a Prog2 executable from these
two files, an sprog2 solution executable, and three files called 
list1.txt, list2.txt and list3.txt which contain test data.
<p>

NOTE: The incremental development described next is merely 
intended to make solving the problem more manageable. 
You only submit the final version.
<p>

<UL>

<LI>
<b>Vers 1</b> Modify Prog2.cpp as follows. 
The data class has three private
data members: firstname, lastname, and phonenumber. 
Write the code for 
the overloaded operator&lt; as well as the  
input and output operators.
<p>

<UL>
<LI>
Objects that have the same lastname should use the
firstnames to determine which is less than the other. Objects
that also have the same firstnames should use the phone numbers
to determine which is less than the other. Treat all data as
character strings.
<p>

<LI>
The list.txt files contain FIRSTNAME LASTNAME PHONENUMBER data.
The input operator reads (extracts) these three strings from an
input stream and assigns them to the appropriate data object members
when called.
The output operator prints the data object members to an output stream 
using the modified format: LASTNAME,FIRSTNAME... PHONENUMBER.
See actual examples below. 
The name field should be rightfilled with dots to create a
fixed width of 23 characters so that all phone numbers are left 
justified to the same column position. The name and phone number
fields are separated by a single blank space.
</UL>

<p>
Do what is needed to make the program read data from stdin,
sort it using the std::sort algorithm, and write the result
to stdout. 
Run tests to make sure the three operators work as intended.
<p>

<LI>
<b>Vers 2</b>
Add command line argument handling. When completed, any one
of the following three ways of executing Prog2 should be valid:
<p>

<pre>
unix> ./Prog2 -stdsort list.txt
unix> ./Prog2 -qsort list.txt
unix> ./Prog2 -qsort k0 k1 list.txt
</pre>

<p>
The first version executes the Vers 1 code.
The second version sorts the data using
your own implementation of quicksort.
The third version partitions the input data using quickselect
before applying quicksort to sort the data in the
range given by integers k0 and k1. 
Without checking,
assume that k0 is less than k1. 
Do check if k0 is less than 0, in which case 
it should silently be changed to 0. 
Likewise, check if k1 is greater than or equal to the number of 
elements in the data array, say N, and if so, silently change 
it to N-1.
All versions read data from list.txt.
The stdsort mode writes to a file called stdsort_list.txt.
The qsort mode writes to a file called qsort_list.txt while the
qsort k0 k1 mode writes to a file called qselect_list.txt.
Update your code from Vers 1 to operate accordingly. Use
std::sort for all three modes 
to test this all works before you continue.
<p>

<LI>
<b>Vers 3</b>
Replace the calls to std::sort for the two qsort modes with 
a call to your own implementation of quicksort.
Update support.h to contain the partition and quicksort 
functions from the class04_sorting_3 handout.
Embed the partition code within the quicksort function,
then change the pivot selection to use a randomly chosen index
in the left-to-right range. Update the code to allow for this 
change in pivot. 
For example, you may need to explicitly check and 
prevent going out-bounds during the search for data pairs to swap. 
You may NOT change how the partitioning works in principle. 
That is, the randomly chosen pivot MUST initially be moved to 
the right,
and the search for out-of-order data MUST proceed as before
with two while-loops that scan from left-to-right and 
right-to-left.
Have the main function set 302 as the seed value (see srand()).
Test that the modified quicksort code works before you continue.
<p>

<LI>
<b>Vers 4</b>
Copy the quickselect() function from the class04_sorting_3 handout.
Embed the random pivot partition code that you created for
quicksort() above. Change the function to take four
arguments, namely, quickselect(A, left, k, right) where A is the 
data array, left and right designate the first and the last indices
to consider (the range), and is k the element that needs to be
selected (found and put in its proper place).
Make whatever other modifications
are needed to get the code to compile. 
<p>

Use quickselect(A, 0, k0, N-1) to put the k0-th element in its
proper location and partition the data in A accordingly.
That is, ensure that all data stored to the left of A[k0]
is lexicographically less than or equal to it.
All data stored to the right of A[k0] must likewise be
greater than or equal to it.
<p>

Use quickselect(A, k0, k1, N-1) to put the k1-th element in its
proper location and partition the data in A accordingly. Note
that data indexed below k0 is ignored at this point. 
<p>

Use quicksort(A, k0, k1) to sort the data in the k0 thru k1 index range.
<p>

This completes the assignment. Submit Prog2.cpp and Support.h after
you have cleaned the code up and added a few comments.
<p>

Notice that the data in lines 1-5 should go before line 6, but it is not sorted. 
Likewise, the data in lines 9-18 should go after line 8, but it is not sorted.
The data has been partitioned correctly relative to lines 6-8 which have been
sorted. 
The above was produced an a MacBook. You may see different orderings on a 
Hydra machine. This has to do with how the random numbers are generated. 
Always run the solution executable to produce output for comparison with
output produced by your code.

Notice that the data is sorted first by lastname 
(ALLEN before ALLISON before ALSTON),
then by firstname (AIDA before EDDY before ... before
SAL), and then phonenumber (MAYRA and SAL). There
may be other examples in the data you are given. 
If not, you can always add some yourself.
