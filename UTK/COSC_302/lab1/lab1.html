<title> CS302 -- Lab Assignment 1</title>

<h1> CS302 -- Lab Assignment 1 (80 pts: Spring 2024)</h1>

<hr>
<h3>Getting motivated</h3>
Welcome to your first CS302 lab. The goal is for you to show that you
master the data structures material covered in CS202. Emphasis is on
their usage rather then their implementation. 
<p>

<hr>
<h3>Lab submission and due date</h3>
A tarball that contains Prog1.cpp, Support.h, and Support.cpp is due 11.59pm 
Tuesday Jan 30, 2024. The code must compile using the given makefile, so
don't include it. As always, make sure you submit source code and not the
executable.
You will not be able to use grace days since this assignment is merely 
warm up. Once the deadline rolls around, time is up. 
<p>

<b>NOTE</b>: The drop deadline is Jan 29. If you find this assignment
exceedingly difficult, now is the time to drop CS302 and hone your 
C++/STL/Unix skills.
<p>

<hr>
<h3>Programs you need to write </h3>

Write the following code. Give yourself ample time as the assignment
may be more difficult than you first think. 
<p>

<UL>
<LI>
Get a copy of lab1.tar from Canvas.
This file contains skeleton files Prog1.cpp, Support.h,
and Support.cpp, and
a makefile for compiling them program into an executable.
In addition, you are given a solution executable called sprog1
and data files weather_TN.csv, weather_SE.csv, and weather_US.csv
for cities in Tennessee, the South East and the entire United States.
The solution executable showcases the functionality described next.
When in doubt about what to do, run the code and study the output.
<p>

<LI>
You are given comma-separated, weekly weather
reports for a number of locations. 
Each weekly report contains the month (1-12) the data was recorded,
the name of the city and state where the weather station was located,
a three-letter geocode (e.g., TYS for Knoxville),
the average amount of precipitation for the week in inches
as well as the average temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.
<p>

<UL>
<LI>
<pre>
unix> cat weather_TN.csv

1,Bristol/Jhnsn Cty/Kngsprt,Tennessee,TRI,0,34
1,Chattanooga,Tennessee,CHA,0,40
1,Clarksville,Tennessee,CKV,0,37
1,Crossville,Tennessee,CSV,0,34
1,Knoxville,Tennessee,TYS,0,36
...
</pre>
</UL>

We will refer to the city, state, and geocode as a location
and the month, precipitation and temperature as raw data.
The assignment has two parts. 
Part 1 reads and writes weekly data.
Part 2 extracts and writes monthly summaries.
You will store location, raw data, and summary data in
a database that also contains the functions needed to
read, extract, and otherwise process everything using
the
data structures described below. NOTE: You MUST use these
data structures to earn points.
<p>

<LI>
For 40 points, write Prog1.cpp to have it check for a command
line argument that specifies printing the weekly data followed
by code that makes printing happen. 
This requires that you also update Support.h and Support.cpp
to have them define and implement data structures
and member functions
needed by the location and rawdata structs and the
database class. Add member function arguments and return
data types as needed.
<p>

<UL>
<LI>
Write location::operator&lt;() to order locations first 
by state and then by city. 
<LI>
Write location::print() to output the location information with 
each line being 42 characters wide.
<LI
Write rawdata::print() to output a weekly data record.
Use fields that are 5 characters wide for each data
item and print floats using 2 decimal places.
<LI>
Write database::init_rawdata() to read and store
the weekly data from a given datafile. Define and
use a <tt>vector&lt; list&lt;rawdata&gt; &gt;</tt>
data structure to hold the weekly data. The first index
of this 2D data structure
is unique to a location. The second index is for the
data records associated with that location.
Define and use a binary search tree that uses location
as the key and an index into the raw data cache for
the raw data. Abstractly,

<pre>
location_map(location,index) --> index
rawdata_cache[index][...] --> output
</pre>

<LI>
Write and use database::extract_rawdata() to replace
spaces with underscores and commas with spaces.

<LI>
Have the main() function instantiate and use a database object
to read and print raw data as described above. When the
command line option to do so is not specified, have main()
proceed to works described next. 
<p>

<LI>
Example output looks as follows:
<pre>
unix> ./Prog1 -rawdata weather_TN.csv

------------------------------------------
Bristol/Jhnsn_Cty/Kngsprt, Tennessee (TRI)
------------------------------------------
    1  0.00    34
    1  0.67    37
	...
   12  0.78    41
    1  1.09    43
   ...
------------------------------------------
Nashville, Tennessee (BNA)
------------------------------------------
    1  0.00    39
    1  0.30    41
    ...
   12  2.17    44
    1  1.22    50
</pre>

Note that each city may have January data at the beginning
and at the end of the year. This is because the last week of the year
is labeled January. Somehow that made sense to the people
who created the data. We will not question the logic.
</UL>
<p>

<LI>
For 40 points, update Prog1.cpp to initialize the monthly
summary data before entering into an infinite loop that 
prompts the user for a location to report for. The location
can be specified either as a state or geocode. If specified
as a state, all locations for the state most be reported.
Once again,
this requires that you update Support.h and Support.cpp
to have them define and implement needed data structures
and member functions.
<p>

<UL>
<LI>
Write summary::summary() to have it initialize the class
data members.
<LI>
Write summary::operator+=() to have it incorporate
a new weekly data record. This means updating 
the number of records seen,
precipitation and temperature sums, as well as
max and min values. Use the avg data members
to store the sums.
<LI>
Write summary::print() to output monthly summaries.
Use fields that are 5 characters wide for each data
item, print floats using 2 decimal places
and ints using 1 decimal place.
<LI>
Write database::init_summary() to compute and
store monthly summaries for each location.
Define and
use a <tt>vector&lt; vector&lt;summary&gt; &gt;</tt>
data structure to hold this data. The first index
of this data structure
is once again unique to a location. The second index are the months
for that location.
To facilitate the search,
define and use two hash maps, namely,
one that uses state as the key and a binary search tree 
that contains geocodes as values, and one
that uses geocode as the key and the corresponding
location as the value.
Abstractly,

<pre>
state_map(state,bst<geocode>) --> geocode1, ..., geocodeN
geocode_map(geocode,location) --> location
location_map(location,index) --> index
summary_cache[index][...] --> output
</pre>

In words, a state query produces a set of geocodes. 
Each geocode produces a location. Each location provides
an index to a list of monthly summaries. Each summary
knows how to print itself. A geocode query simply bypasses
the first step.

<LI>
Write and use database::extract_summary() to iterate
thru the location_map data structure and update
the monthly summary data cache. When done iterating
thru the raw data for a particular location, convert
the precipitation and temperature sums to averages.
<LI>
Write and use database::print() to print monthly
location summaries. If the target location is a
state, push all associated geocodes onto a queue.
If the target location is a geocode, simply push
it onto the queue. Either way, use the geocodes
stored by said queue to print the relevant information.
<LI>

<p>
Example output looks as follows:
<pre>
unix> ./Prog1 weather_TN.csv

Dec:  0.49  2.18  1.62 :  40.0  46.0  43.0
print> CTRL-D
</pre>

Hint: Unlike the raw data, which is ordered by location,
the monthly summary state output is ordered by geocode.
This is a result of loading the queue that produces the
output with geocodes stored in alphabetical order.
<p>
</UL>

<LI>
When reading the assignment, try to create a mental picture of the
data, how stored and handled. Better yet, make a simple sketch on
a piece of paper. Nothing fancy. Just enough to wrap your head
around the problem. You may get it the first time. You may need
need to do it a couple of times.

<h3>Grade rubric</h3>
<p>
NOTE 1: 
Code that doesn't compile and/or run will most likely be given a 
score of 0. Effort is nice but ultimately code has to work in
the real world, and we don't have the time to debug when grading.
So, make sure you have a correctly functioning executable for 
the program you submit.
Verify your output against the solution exectuables. 
The TAs will do the same when grading. 
Note that simply matching the output doesn't guarantee full credit for an 
assignment. The code must be implemented correctly as well. 

<p>
NOTE 2: Always follow the instructions given in lab assignments.
Automated grading scripts will look for class definitions and functions. 
<b>You must therefore use naming conventions described</b>.

<p>
NOTE 3: Appropriate comments are expected for all your programs.
Don't simply provide a literal translation of each line of code. 
In fact, don't provide a literal translation of any line of code. 
Comments should explain the computation. 
Imagine yourself looking at the code months or years from now. 
What would you need to know to figure out what's going on?
Better yet,
imagine someone else looking at the code now.
What do they need to know to figure out what's going on?
